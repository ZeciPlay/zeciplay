    "description": "This was the official companion app for Assassin's Creed: Unity, designed to enhance the main console/PC game experience. It allowed players to manage a brotherhood of assassins, send them on puzzle missions, unlock in-game items like outfits, and explore an interactive 3D map of Paris. All app-exclusive content was later integrated into the main game via patch. The app was retired from official stores years ago.",
